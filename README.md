# Pipelined RV32IMC
Design and Implementation of a Pipelined RV32IMC Processor with Interrupt Support for Large-scale Wireless Sensor Networks

Week 1:
  + Baseline Processor (5-stage Pipeline excluding Stalling & flushing)
  + Testbench (Verilog and/or SysVerilog + Assembly code)
  + Assembler
  + Tool familiarization (Uploading to FPGA, using built-in USB-UART bridge, uploading a single-cycle MIPS processor using readmemh for INSTMEM & DATAMEM)

Week 2:
  + Baseline Processor RTL Code continuation
  + Assembler
  + Verilog Testbench
  + Baseline processor Testing
